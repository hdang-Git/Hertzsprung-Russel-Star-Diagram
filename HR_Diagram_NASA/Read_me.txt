This is a small test project reading data from NASA to display a HR Diagram

Hertzsprung–Russell Diagram

This is a scatter plot that helps show the relationship between star's 
absolute magnitudes and luminosity vs the spectrum and temperature (Stefan-Boltzman Law)

to run and test the program:

1. open HR_Diagram.jar
2. hit [Upload Data] Button
3. find the "stardata.txt" file in the [data] folder of project.
		(a hyperlinkk of the source is in the program)
4. hit [ok] and watch the program populate with data.

feel free to select any amount of stars on table on the right.

(future possible changes)  store information into a database,
and compare the v-magnitude and v-apparent and toggle both to see a comparison
