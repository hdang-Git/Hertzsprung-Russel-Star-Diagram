           <h2>Why is astronomy important?</h2>
           <h4>
              AT&T uses Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) which is software written by National Optical Astronomy Observatory to analyze computer programs.
              The iPhone's camera is a charge-coupled device (CCD) converting movement of electrical charge to digital value.
              This instrument was originally developed by astronomers.
           </h4>
           <br/>
           <h2>How is it beneficial to society?</h2>
           <h4>
              Astronomy is used in most cameras, webcams, and cellphones today because of CCD.
           </h4>
           <br />
           <h2>Einstein's theory of relativity</h2>
           <h4>
              Law of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers; speed of light in a vacuum is the same no matter the speed at which the observer travels.
              Space and time are events that could occur at the same time for one observer could occur at different times for another.
              This is a true time warp and occurs because of the planet's rotation.
           </h4>
           <br />
           <h2>Hubble telescope</h2>
           <h4>
              The hubble telescope orbits outside distortion of the Earth's atmosphere.
              The hubble takes extremely high resolution images with negligible background light, allowing deep views of time and space.
              Many observations have lead to breakthroughs in astrophysics.
